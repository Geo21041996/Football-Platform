# Football-Platform

This is a web page about a sports betting platform in the field of football. To create this page, I was inspired by a design already created in Figma where I used two typical languages from the front end development area, namely HTML and CSS.
In Html I created the structure of the web page, and in css I styled the web page
In the first phase I created the dark blue background of the page, and later I divided the page into 5 adjacent sections. For this I used a principle of grids, specifically CSS
In the first section, I added and centered a banner with a large illustrated ball, to attract the public's attention.
Below this I have added the scores related to the football matches in progress and have centered the area on the page at the global level
Below this I created a design made up of 3 rectangles, one below and three on the side with a shade of light blue to create an audience-pleasing design
